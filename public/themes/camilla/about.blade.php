			My name is Camilla Gejl, I'm 18 years old and live in Randers, Denmark. I'm currently studying Social Science at Langkaer Gymnasium in Aarhus, wanting to study Sociology when I've graduated.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've made this blog, because I always have too many opinions about things to keep spamming facebook with it. ;) In general, I think my facebook friends might be quite annoyed by my face being on their frontpage all the time, saying "Camilla commented on -insert newspage-'s status", and stuff like that, so I'll try to put my thoughts on this page instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will probably mainly post about politics and other social matters, but since I live in Denmark, it'd be quite inappropriate to comment on my country's politics in English. Therefore, you might see a lot of Danish posts coming as well - but I'll keep as much in English as I can.
			It won't be all about politics though - this blog will be about everything that comes to my mind; politics, movies, anime/cosplay, photography or whatever else of my interests. :) So I hope I will post something that will interest you. :D
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you enjoy your stay~
